## Security

This document describes the security measures implemented in the backend of the eCommerce application. These measures are designed to protect the application from a variety of attacks, including:

* Unauthorized access
* Data breaches
* Code injection
* Denial-of-service attacks

### Authentication and Authorization

The application uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication system. Users must authenticate themselves by providing their username and password. If the authentication is successful, the server will generate a JWT and return it to the user. The user can then use the JWT to access protected resources on the server.

The application uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to authorize users to access resources. Each user is assigned a role, and each resource is assigned a set of permissions. A user can only access a resource if the user's role has the permissions required to access that resource.

### Data Protection

The application encrypts sensitive data at rest and in transit. Sensitive data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 encryption. Sensitive data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3 encryption.

The application also uses other measures to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, and modification, such as:

* Salting and hashing passwords
* Data loss prevention (DLP)

### Code Injection Prevention

The application uses input validation and other techniques to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into the application. All user input is validated before it is processed by the application. The application also uses a SQL injection prevention library to protect against SQL injection attacks.

### Denial-of-Service Attack Protection

The application uses a variety of measures to protect itself from denial-of-service attacks, such as rate limiting and load balancing. Rate limiting prevents attackers from flooding the application with requests. Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple servers, which makes it more difficult for attackers to take down the application.

### Security Monitoring

The application is monitored for security threats using a variety of tools and techniques. These tools and techniques include:

* Log aggregation and analysis
* Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
* Web application firewall (WAF)

### Security Response Plan

The application has a security response plan in place to deal with security incidents. The plan includes the following steps:

1. Identify and contain the incident
2. Assess the impact of the incident
3. Notify affected users and regulators
4. Re
